# 2. Add Two Numbers

Putting my C code here for a LeetCode problem as their C compiler is incredibly dogshit/impossible to do anything with and I don't want my code to go to waste.

## Compiling

### Get GCC if you haven't already

Linux

apt:
`sudo apt install gcc`
pacman:
`sudo pacman -S gcc`

Windows

don care go install on your own

### Compile

`gcc main.c -o main.exe`

Congratulations, you are now smarter than LeetCode itself. (LeetCodes compiler would just error here)
